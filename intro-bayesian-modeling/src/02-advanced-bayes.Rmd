## The sinister serologist
\pause
In the research labs of the Church of Human Potential, Reverend William Stryker oversees the Mutant Serology Department.\pause{} One project is to develop a field test for the ``X gene" that distinguishes mutants from baseline humans.\pause

## The sinister serologist

Reverend Stryker's new field test can accurately detect the X mutation \color{red}99\% \color{black} of the time, but will also falsely indicate that a baseline human is a mutant \color{red}2\% \color{black} of the time.  \pause

When Stryker presents his results to the Pentagon, Senator Robert Kelly asks two questions: \pause

- What is the probability that a subject is a mutant, when your field test says that it is mutant? 
- What is the probability that a subject is a mutant, when your field test says that it is baseline? 

## The sinister serologist

Call the event that a specific subject is a mutant ${\cal M}$, and that it is baseline $\neg {\cal M}$. 

Call the event that Stryker's field test diagnoses a subject as a mutant $D$, and that it diagnoses it baseline $\neg D$. 

Senator Kelly's interest is in the probability the subject is indeed a mutant given it has been diagnosed as a mutant, or $P({\cal M}|D)$, and the probability the subject is a mutant given it has been diagnosed as baseline, or $P({\cal M}|\neg D)$. 

## The sinister serologist

The posterior probability the subject is a mutant given a mutant diagnosis is $\approx .047$.

The posterior probability that a subject is a mutant, given it is diagnosed as baseline is $\approx .000010$.

## The sinister serologist
An advantage of using Bayes' Rule in this way is that it gracefully extends to more complex scenarios.

Suppose that Stryker knows that his diagnosis is statistically independent from the diagnosis of his research associate Didier Raoult, and suppose that both Stryker and Raoult return the mutant diagnosis. Now what is the posterior probability that the subject is a mutant?\pause

It is $\approx .71$.
