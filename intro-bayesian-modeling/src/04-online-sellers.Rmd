## Online Sellers

- This introductory modeling example comes from the YouTube channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8idr1WZ1A7Q&t=25s), and involves comparing the positive ratings of three online sellers.
- They each have different numbers of positive ratings from different numbers of total user evaluations.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline
Seller & Positive & Total & Percentage \\
\hline
One & 10 & 10 & 100\% \\
Two & 48 & 50 & 96\% \\
Three & 186 & 200 & 93\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

- The research question is to infer from these data which seller has the highest probability of providing a positive buying experience.

## Online Sellers (Continued)

- The data are the counts \(k_i\) of positive ratings out of \(n_i\) total evaluations for the \(i\)th seller.
  - This means that \(k_1=10\), \(k_2=48\), \(k_3=186\) and \(n_1=10\), \(n_2=50\), \(n_3=200\).
- A simple statistical model of the rating behavior is to assume the \(i\)th seller has some underlying probability \(\theta_i\) of generating a positive review each time they are evaluated.
  - \(\theta_i\) are parameters, since they are latent probabilities controlling the process that generates the data.
  - Let us assume that these probabilities are equally likely to take any possible value, so \(\theta_i \sim \mathrm{uniform}(0,1)\).
- The process that generates the positive counts is then given by \(k_i \sim \mathrm{binomial}(\theta_i, n_i)\).

## Exercise

Implement the model with these data and assumptions in JAGS.
Which seller is better?

- The probabilities are equally likely to take any possible value, so \(\theta_i \sim \mathrm{uniform}(0,1)\).
- The process that generates the positive counts is given by \(k_i \sim \mathrm{binomial}(\theta_i, n_i)\).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline
Seller & Positive & Total & Percentage \\
\hline
One & 10 & 10 & 100\% \\
Two & 48 & 50 & 96\% \\
Three & 186 & 200 & 93\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

## Rate Inferences

- The posterior distributions for the underlying rate of positive ratings show what values are possible, based on the data and the assumptions of the model.

## Rate Inferences (Continued)

- The posterior distributions can be summarized by 95\% credible intervals, which are \((0.70, 1.00)\) for Seller 1, \((0.86, 0.99)\) for Seller 2, and \((0.89, 0.96)\) for Seller 3.

## Which Seller is Better?

- The posterior distributions represent everything we know about the possible underlying rates of positive reviews.
- But, answering "Which seller is better?" requires being clear on what it means to be better, and applying that criterion to the posterior distributions.
  - One approach would be to find the seller who is most likely to have a better positive rate than the other two, which is Seller 2.

\begin{center}\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline
& Seller 1 & Seller 2 & Seller 3 \\
\hline
Seller 1 & -- & 0.46 & 0.57 \\
Seller 2 & 0.54 & -- & 0.70 \\
Seller 3 & 0.43 & 0.30 & -- \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

- Another approach would be to find the seller with the greatest probability of having at least a 90\% positive rate.
  - These are 0.68 for Seller 1, 0.89 for Seller 2, 0.92 for Seller 3.

## Key Points

- Online sellers is a simple introductory model, but has the basic features of a parameter that controls a data-generating process, and observed data.
- Inference about parameters represents uncertainty about their possible values, based on the available data and the assumptions of the model.
